Welcome to Checkers! A game we all grew up playing against our sibling and other family members. This classic game
has stood the test of time. This is the classic game of checkers!

Two Players Required

Use of our interface:

1. The game will initially load straight in with the board and pieces in place.
2. There will be a menu bar at the top that will allow the user to change the colors of their pieces throughout the game.
3. To start the game select a piece that has an ability to move. Once a piece is selected the tile the piece is sitting on will
   become yellow.
4. After selecting your piece you may click on the nearest, valid spot in order to move your piece. If you have the opportunity
   and choose to jump an opponents piece simply click to the spot on the other side of the opponents piece (just like regular checkers).
    - Multiple jumps must be performed one jump at a time.
5. If you would like to exit the game early select the menu bar quit and exit game or simply press CRTL+X.
6. If you would like to restart the game there is an option in the 'Options' tab of the menu that will allow you to do this or use CTRL + R. *(This cannot be done once a game has completed)*
7. If a player no longer has pieces on the board the game is over and popup box will come up declaring a winner. If a player has no moves, they must forfeit using the menu bar or reset and start a new game.

Other Important Information:
- Player 1 will default as the color RED and player 2 will default as the color NEON-GREEN.
- Player 1 will always have the first move.
- Player 1 will always be located at the top.
- A king piece is represented by a smaller yellow circle (the crown) on top of the normal piece.
- SUPER IMPORTANT: Following a jump of a piece, you may look for a second jump or simply allow the next player to go by clicking twice on the piece that just jumped or using the accelerator CTRL + S
  or using the menu/menu item at the top.

Possible Extra Credit Features:
1. Menu bar is not necessary for the game, however, it was added to make it easier to navigate to exit/restart the game.
2. In the menu bar, there are options for each player to select which color they would like to be and can be changed at any point during
   the game.
3. There is an accelerator added so that exiting the game may be easier. (CTRL + X)
4. There is a victory popup box declaring victory to either player 1 or 2. After 'ok' is hit program closes.
5. There is a menu item allowing the restart of the game at an instant. Accelerator added to it as well (CTRL + R)
6. Tile the selected piece on 'lights up' and turns yellow.
7. Forfeit addition in menu bar.
